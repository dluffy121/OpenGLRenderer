# Basic OpenGL Renderer

A Learning project to not only learn about the OpenGL Graphics Library but also learn C++ Language

## Capabilities

1. Multiple GLFW Windows
2. GLSL Shader programming
3. Texture Creation
4. Creating GameVastu (GameObjects)
5. Attaching Components to it, like

    - Renderer \- uses Vertex Coordinates, Texture Coordinates, and Triangle Indices to render objects
    - Camera \- inturn used by GLFW Window to generate proper MVP for each rendered objects

<!-- 5. Using Transforms to change Position, Rotation and Scale of GameVastu -->

<!-- ## Examples -->
<!-- Following are few examples of code samples to render things using OpenGL -->
